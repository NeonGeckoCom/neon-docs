# Using Neon OS
Some tips for using Neon OS.

## First Run
The first time you boot Neon OS, there are some one-time processes that need to
run. Please be patient as the first boot will need to resize partitions and 
perform some other initialization. At times, it may appear the device isn't doing
anything, but please don't disconnect power as this can break the installation
on the USB drive. This process may take up to 10 minutes, though it is generally
faster.

When presented an option to continue setup, follow the prompts to connect to a
network.

After network setup is complete, there will be some skills loading in the background;
when those are loaded, the spinner in the top right corner of the screen will 
animate and the homescreen will be displayed. At this point, Neon is set up and
ready to go!
