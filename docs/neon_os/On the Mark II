## Making an Additional Boot Drive
Summary: 
To create an additional bootable drive using your Mark II, plug a second USB or an SSD into the right hand blue port, and say "Hey Neon, make bootable media" then follow the prompts. When finished, shut down your device, move the new drive into the first port and plug it back in. 

### Detailed Instructions 
Supplies needed:
1. An SSD (or USB) drive with a minimum of 8GB and USB 3.0 connection. *Any content on the drive will be deleted during this process.*

Preparation:
1. Make sure your Neon OS is up to date. We reccomend updating to the current release, rather than a beta version. *Say, "Enable stable updates" and "Check for updates"*
2. Have your Mark II running.
3. Plan for this to take about an hour. It may be much faster.
4. When booting using your new drive, you will need to reestablish your internet connection. Other personal information you have taught Neon such as your name will be retained on your original boot drive, but will not be on your new one.

Process:
1. Plug the SSD or USB drive that you want to make into your new boot drive into the upper (blue) USB port to the right of your existing USB drive.
2. Tell Neon to "Make Bootable Media". *It will ask you to confirm. Then it will download the new OS image file. How long this takes depends on your internet speed and the speed of your current boot drive. It may take as little as 10 minutes, or up to an hour.*
3. When the download is finished, an alert icon will appear on the upper left of the screen and Neon will ask you to confirm that you want it to write to your new SSD drive.  *At this time Neon is not providing this verbal alert, we'll have that fixed soon.* 
Select the alert by touching the alert icon, and then the words of the alert itself. Neon should give you a verbal prompt to complete the process, warning you it will erase anything on that drive. Confirm you want it to do that. *The time it takes to write the image to the new drive varies based on the drive speeds of both drives. 10 minutes is a reasonable estimate.*
5. When it's finished writing the image, it will tell you, and an alert will appear again at the top left of the screen. When you confirm verbally or select the alert, Neon will shut down automatically. *At this time Neon is not providing this verbal alert, we'll have that fixed soon.* 
6. Shut down your device as normal if for any reason it did not shut down on its own.
7. Unplug the power from your Mark II.
8. Unplug your original drive, and move the new drive over into the upper left USB port.
9. Plug power back in and Neon will boot up from the new drive.
