# Neon OS Installation
Neon OS is a minimal operating system currently targeting the Mycroft Mark2.

## Getting Neon OS
Neon OS is made available as downloadable images and also through distribution of
pre-installed media.

### Downloadable Image
Neon OS images are available for download from [neon.ai](https://neon.ai/NeonAIforMycroftMarkII).
The website is updated with new images as they are published and images may be written to
an 8GB or larger USB flash drive, USB SSD, or Micro SD card.

### Prepared Boot Media
If you prefer a simpler solution, NeonAIÂ® sells prepared boot devices on 
our [square site](https://neonai.square.site/s/shop). USB and SSD drives with the latest
Neon OS are available for purchase and can be shipped internationally.

## Installing a Downloaded Image to a USB Drive
Neon OS can be installed to a USB drive or SSD to use with a Mark 2 or Raspberry
Pi device.

### Requirements
- A USB 3.0 flash drive or SSD that is at least 32GB capacity
- Raspberry Pi Imager which may be downloaded [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
- An internet connection to download the Neon OS image
