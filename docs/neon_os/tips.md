# Tips
Here are a few useful tips for working with NeonOS

## SSH
You can connect a remote terminal to your NeonOS device using SSH and the default
username/password of `neon`/`neon`. For most terminals, the command will look like:
```
ssh neon@<Neon Device IP Address>
```

## On-device Terminal
A terminal can be accessed on a NeonOS device by connecting a keyboard and
pressing `ctrl`+`shift`+`f1`. The terminal will be shown on-screen until dismissed
but note that changes in the GUI may take focus away from the terminal until you tap/click it again.

## Taking a screenshot
You can ask Neon to "take a screenshot" to create a screenshot saved on-device.
The path of the created file will be displayed on-screen as a notification. To
retrieve a screenshot, you can use `scp` or shut down your mark 2 and plug the
USB drive into another computer that can read an EXT4 file system(Linux or MacOS).

## Getting device IP address
You can ask Neon "what is my IP address" to get the device IP address. You can
also access this via the `Settings Menu`, under `About`.
