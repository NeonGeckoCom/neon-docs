## Removing a Release Workflow
This describes the process for removing a beta or stable Neon OS release.

### Application
This process applies in the following situations:
- It is dictated by a release workflow to remove a release.
- A major issue is found and a maintainer deems it necessary to remove a release.

### Process
- Delete the release from GitHub.
- If release files have been uploaded to any public servers for download, remove
  them.
- If an announcement has been made in the forums, edit the announcement to 
  indicate the release has been removed, including a reason for its removal.

### Exceptions
- If this is a beta release and the release files do not contain any sensitive
  information, they may be left on the public server.
