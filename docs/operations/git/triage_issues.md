## Triage GitHub Issues
This describes the process for triaging new issues on GitHub

### Application
This process applies in the following situations:
- A new issue is created in a repository you maintain
- A weekly review of the [GitHub Issues Report](https://github.com/NeonGeckoCom/.github/actions/workflows/get_issues.yml)
> The process below applies to each issue

### Process
- Open the new issue on GitHub.
- Read the issue comment and verify it is valid and complete.

    - If this is a duplicate issue, apply the `duplicate` tag, close it with a comment linking the existing issue.
    - If the issue is mis-categorized as a bug or feature, update the PR title.
    - If the issue is in the wrong repository, transfer it as appropriate.

- If you know about more context (i.e. a chat thread or forum post), add it to the issue description.
- If more information is needed for debugging, reply to the issue asking the author to clarify.
- Verify the correct labels are applied (`bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, etc.)
- Assign the issue to the "Community Projects" board if applicable.
  > Issues in public repositories generally belong here in the "Other Helpful Tasks" section.
- If you are going to address the issue, assign yourself to the issue.
- If the issue can be addressed by a community member with minimal knowledge of other
  interacting repositories, add the `help wanted` label.
- If the `triage` label is applied to the issue, remove it

### Exceptions
- There should be no exceptions to this process.
