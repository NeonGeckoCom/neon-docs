# Neon Documentation
Welcome to the official Neon AI速 Documentation. All Neon AI速 project documentation
is available here and is updated regularly from source project repositories.

## Get Involved
The best place to get involved is on the [openconversational.ai forums](https://community.openconversational.ai)
or [Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#neon-ai-community:matrix.org).
You can interact with Neon developers and other users there to discuss projects,
find support, and provide feedback. Also feel free to open issues and pull requests
in any of [our repositories](https://github.com/NeonGeckoCom).

## Get In Touch
If you want to get in touch with us directly, 
you can reach us at [info@neon.ai](mailto:info@neon.ai).

## Partner Projects
We are proud to partner with other projects with our shared goal of making great
open source products.

### OpenVoiceOS
The OpenVoiceOS project is a closely related project to Neon AI速 with many shared
components and regular collaboration. You can find more information at 
[OpenVoiceOS.com](https://openvoiceos.com/), and in their chat rooms
[on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!XFpdtmgyCoPDxOMPpH:matrix.org?via=matrix.org).

### Mycroft AI
Mycroft Core is where Neon and OVOS both started. NeonAI速 was a Mycroft 
Channel Partner, working with them to provide solutions focused on enterprise 
users and other integrations. Mycroft has dissolved and Neon is maintaining the
evolution of their forums at 
[community.openconversational.ai](https://community.openconversational.ai).
