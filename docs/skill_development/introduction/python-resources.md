Mycroft uses Python 3 and as of December 2019 supports Python 3.5-3.7.

The following are a collection of resources recommended by members of our Community. If you know of other great resources please let us know in the [Dev channel of Mycroft Chat](https://chat.mycroft.ai/community/channels/dev).

## Books

### Think Python

"[Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) is an introduction to Python programming for beginners. It starts with basic concepts of programming, and is carefully designed to define all terms when they are first used and to develop each new concept in a logical progression. Larger pieces, like recursion and object-oriented programming are divided into a sequence of smaller steps and introduced over the course of several chapters."

The book is available to purchase through normal retailers, or to download for free from [Green Tea Press](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)
