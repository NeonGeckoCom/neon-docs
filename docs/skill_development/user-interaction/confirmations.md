# Confirmations

**Note:** The links to the various NeonSkill methods in this documentation point to the `mycroft-core` documentation. There is no material difference between them for the methods referenced and, since there is not publicly available `neon_core` documentation, we will reference `mycroft-core` instead.

May be verbal or non-verbal. See the [Voice User Interface Design Guidelines section on Confirmations](../voice-user-interface-design-guidelines/interactions-and-guidelines/confirmations)

## Non-verbal Confirmation
