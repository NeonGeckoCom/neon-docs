  meaningful interactions with Users of your Skill.

# User interaction

## Intents

The initial interactions with your Skill will start with a general utterance from the User. [Your Skill must register intents](intents/) that it can handle and Neon will then determine which Skill can respond to the Users request.

## Statements

[Neon can speak any information that you need to communicate to the User](statements.md).

## Prompts

If you need to prompt the User for information, [you can use a range of methods to ask different types of questions](prompts.md).

## Parsing Utterances

A common process within a Skill is to parse the contents of an utterance. [Neon provides a range of easy to use methods for this task](parsing.md).

## Confirmations

[Confirmations are used to verify that the input from the User was understood correctly](confirmations.md). These may be verbal or non-verbal.

## Conversational Context

For more complex cases, [a Skill can add context to the Intent Parser to create more natural conversational interaction](conversational-context.md).

## Converse

[Converse allows a recently active Skill to inspect utterances before the normal intent handling process](converse.md).
