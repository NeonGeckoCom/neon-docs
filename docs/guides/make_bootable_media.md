# Make Bootable Media
How to image a drive using your Mark II's "Make Bootable Media" skill.

## Requires
Two USB drives, or a USB drive and an SSD drive, or two SSD drives with supplemental power to one of them. Any data on the secondary drive will be erased by this process. 

## Steps
1. Start with your machine booted up, with the boot drive in the upper left USB port.
2. Plug in your secondary drive in the upper right USB port. 
3. Say "Hey Neon, make bootable media".
4. Follow the prompts.
5. When finished, shut down your Mark II and unplug the power. 
6. Unplug the boot drive you were using from the left USB port and set it aside. 
7. Move the second boot drive from the right hand port to the left hand port. 
8. Plug power back in to your Mark II. 
9. Congratulations, you're on the new version! 
10. If you would like to use the new version on your original boot drive, simply repeat this process.

## Troubleshooting
- The Mark II may not provide enough power to run two SSD drives at the same time.
