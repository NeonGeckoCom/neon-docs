# Make Bootable Media
How to image a drive using your Mark II's "Make Bootable Media" intent.

## Requires
Two USB drives, or a USB drive and an SSD drive, or two SSD drives with supplemental power to one of them. Any data on the secondary drive will be erased by this process. 

## Steps
1. Start with your machine booted up, with the boot drive in the upper USB port closest to the center of the back of your Mark II.
2. Plug in your secondary drive in the second USB port, which is closer to the edge of the back of your Mark II. 
3. Say "Hey Neon, make bootable media".
4. Follow the prompts.
5. When finished, shut down your Mark II and unplug the power. 
6. Unplug the boot drive you were using to run your Mark II and set it aside. 
7. Plug power back in to your Mark II (you can move the new boot drive to the other port, but it is not necessary unless you have an extra drive you want to plug in). 
8. Congratulations, you're on the new version! 
9. If you would like to use the new version on your original boot drive, simply repeat this process.

## Troubleshooting
- The Mark II may not provide enough power to run two SSD drives at the same time.
